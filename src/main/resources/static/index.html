                    </header>
                        <p>With <span class="emphasis">6+ years' experience</span> in UX Analysis, Research, and

                        <p>At ForeSee, I was <span class="emphasis">promoted to Senior Analyst within 3 years</span> for
                            quality of analysis, thought leadership, project turnaround time,
                            and leadership skills.</p>
                        <p>Consistently assigned to ForeSee's largest accounts, I am responsible
                            for <span class="emphasis">supporting multi-million dollar contract renewals.</span></p>

                        <p class="tagline">Gaining stakeholder trust and making a persuasive case for change.</p>
                        <p><span class="emphasis">I regularly lead online and onsite consultation.</span> Whether speaking to the executive suite
                            or product designers, I present a clear and actionable message that <span class="emphasis">motivates
                                stakeholders</span> to take on challenging digital redesigns.</p>

                    <p class="tagline">Breaking through organizational silos.</p>
                    <p>Because <span class="emphasis">UX improvement depends on interdepartmental cooperation</span>,
                        I scope projects to capture the full customer journey.<br class="mobile-portrait-only"><br class="mobile-portrait-only">
                        This often <span class="emphasis">brings previously dissociated teams together.</span>
                        I learn the client's language and business challenges,
                        and foster receptivity by affirming their strengths.</p>

                        By providing a <span class="emphasis">roadmap of immediate + long-term

                    <p class="tagline">Improving navigation and making content findable.</p>
                    <p>I have helped dozens of clients <span class="emphasis">reorganize difficult to navigate
                        websites</span> by making sure customers understand what products and
                        information are available to them, where it is located, and how to reach it.</p>

                        I diagrammed a new Role-Based Content Organization which was implemented on the site and lead to improved

                    <p class="tagline">Resolving pain points before it goes live.</p>
                    <p>I provide <span class="emphasis">rapid feedback on prototypes for Agile clients</span>, ranging
                        from live online consultation to formal write-ups with mock-ups.
                        I help your clients maximize UX during development, when it is most cost-effective.</p>

                        I helped CareCredit <span class="emphasis">manage the switch to responsive design</span>, simplify navigation,

                    <p>Using quantifiable survey metrics, I leverage Foresee Replay

                        I was able to identify missed opportunities for linkage, clearer messaging,
                        and stronger visual cues.<br class="mobile-portrait-only"><br class="mobile-portrait-only">Using these insights, coupled with what customers
                        said about their experiences, I provided AT&T with targeted recommendations

                    <p>I evaluate clients' UX for <span class="emphasis">seamless, integrated experience</span> across all devices and scenarios.
                        I stay current with native and web app capabilities, ensure interactions consider the physical
                        or cognitive challenges of users, and strive to create delightful products and services
                        by helping clients design with an innovative mindset.</p>

                    <p>I helped Sam's Club tackle designing Easy Reorder and In-Store Pickup.
                        After identifying opportunities and pitfalls, I provided nuanced recommendations
